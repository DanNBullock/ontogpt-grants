    Text:

    Most individuals naturally generate adequate amounts of vitamin D through ordinary
    dietary intake of vitamin D (in some foods like eggs, fish, and cheese) and natural
    photochemical conversion of the vitamin D3 precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol in the
    skin via exposure to sunlight [L5689, F4027, F4042, F4048]. Additionally, it is
    believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this
    bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric
    complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called
    vitamin D response elements [L5689]. When bound, various transcription factors
    attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated
    gene''s activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes
    that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to
    control a multitude of genes across the genome [L5689].  It is in this way that
    cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated
    with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin
    D deficiency [L5689]. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol
    may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing
    apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting
    foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells
    in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous
    antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of
    CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions [L5689].

    When acting as an oral anesthetic for relieving sore throats, it is generally

    nerve impulses for feeling or transmitting pain signals in the local area to which
    the hexylresorcinol is applied [F58]. Finally, there are ongoing studies that
    have reported hexylresorcinol''s abilities to induce the differentiation of SCC-9
    squamous cell cell-line by way of the modulation of the E2F-mediated signaling
    pathway and suppress the growth of squamous cell carcinoma SCC-9 cells in a dose-dependent
    manner [L2736]. Moreover, such studies have also shown that hexylresorcinol is
    seemingly capable of dose-dependent induction of SCC-9 cell apoptosis as well
    as the inhibition of transglutaminase-2 enzyme activity which can facilitate chemotherapy

    Pseudoephedrine acts mainly as an agonist of alpha adrenergic receptors[A189381]
    and less strongly as an agonist of beta adrenergic receptors.[A10896] This agonism
    of adrenergic receptors produces vasoconstriction which is used as a decongestant[A188823,L11031,L11037,L11040,L11046,L11052,L11058,L11061]

    of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin transporters.[A17168,A17169] The sympathomimetic
    effects of pseudoephedrine include an increase in mean arterial pressure, heart
    rate, and chronotropic response of the right atria.[A17197] Pseudoephedrine is

    Loracarbef is an oral, synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic of the carbacephem class.
    Chemically, carbacephems differ from cephalosporin-class antibiotics in the dihydrothiazine
    ring where a methylene group has been substituted for a sulfur atom. Loracarbef
    has a spectrum of activity similar to that of the second generation cephalosporins.
    It is structurally identical to cefaclor except for a sulfur atom that has been
    replaced by a methylene group. This change gives greater chemical stability in
    solution and allows storage at room temperature. Loracarbef, like all b-lactams
    and cephalosporins, inhibits penicillin binding proteins, enzymes that create
    the cross-linkage of the peptidoglycan polymer. This binding leads to interference
    with the formation and remodeling of the cell wall structure.

    Text:

    Cortisone acetate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding
    the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into
    the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE)
    in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts
    with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific
    target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to
    involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition
    arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
    Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which
    then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into
    contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid
    production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed,
    potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation
    Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids.
    Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular
    space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various
    inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis,
    respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal
    enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils,
    macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids
    due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin
    and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference
    with antigen-antibody binding.

    Text:

    The anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects of NSAIDs appear to
    result from the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. Although the exact mechanism
    of action has not been determined, these effects appear to be mediated through
    the inhibition of the COX-2 isoenzyme at the sites of inflammation with subsequent
    reduction in the synthesis of certain prostaglandins from their arachidonic acid
    precursors. Rofecoxib selectively inhibits the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme,
    which is important for the mediation of inflammation and pain. Unlike non-selective
    NSAIDs, rofecoxib does not inhibit platelet aggregation. It also has little to

    Text:

    Cortisone acetate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding
    the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into
    the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE)
    in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts
    with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific
    target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to
    involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition
    arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
    Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which
    then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into
    contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid
    production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed,
    potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation
    Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids.
    Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular
    space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various
    inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis,
    respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal
    enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils,
    macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids
    due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin
    and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference
    with antigen-antibody binding.

    in _in vitro_ studies, the DNA-cleaving actions of bleomycin is dependent on oxygen

    Text:

    As a gonadotropin inhibitor, danazol suppresses the pituitary-ovarian axis possibly
    by inhibiting the output of pituitary gonadotropins. Danazol also depresses the
    preovulatory surge in output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
    hormone (LH), thereby reducing ovarian estrogen production. Danazol may also directly
    inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis; bind to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid
    receptors; bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin;
    and increases the metabolic clearance rate of progesterone. Another mechanism
    of action by which danazol may use to facilitate regression of endometriosis is
    by decreasing IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations, as well as phospholipid and IgG
    isotope autoantibodies. In the treatment of endometriosis, as a consequence of
    suppression of ovarian function,  danazol causes both normal and ectopic endometrial
    tissues to become inactive and atrophic. This leads to anovulation and associated
    amenorrhea. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol
    is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result
    of decreased ovarian production of estrogen. A direct effect on steroid receptor
    sites in breast tissue is also possible. This leads to a disappearance of nodularity,
    relief of pain and tenderness, and possibly changes in the menstrual pattern.
    In terms of hereditary angioedema, danazol corrects the underlying biochemical
    deficiency by increasing serum concentrations of the deficient C1 esterase inhibitor,
    resulting in increased serum concentrations of the C4 component of the complement
    system. (Source: PharmGKB)

    cell wall synthesis due to a high affinity of aztreonam for penicillin binding
    protein 3 (PBP3). By binding to PBP3, aztreonam inhibits the third and last stage
    of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Cell lysis is then mediated by bacterial cell
    wall autolytic enzymes such as autolysins. It is possible that aztreonam interferes
    with an autolysin inhibitor.

    Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX),
    inhibiting both the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes.
    COX catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic
    acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2).
    Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process

    Text:

    The precise mechanism of the analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions of diflunisal
    is not known. Diflunisal is a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor. In animals,
    prostaglandins sensitize afferent nerves and potentiate the action of bradykinin
    in inducing pain. Since prostaglandins are known to be among the mediators of
    pain and inflammation, the mode of action of diflunisal may be due to a decrease
    of prostaglandins in peripheral tissues.

    microtubule-associated protein-like 4) fusion protein that causes proliferation
    of NSCLC cells. Inhibition of ALK prevents phosphorylation and subsequent downstream
    activation of STAT3 and AKT resulting in reduced tumour cell viability. Both alectinib

    Lomefloxacin is a bactericidal fluoroquinolone agent with activity against a wide
    range of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. The bactericidal action of
    lomefloxacin results from interference with the activity of the bacterial enzymes
    DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, which are needed for the transcription and replication
    of bacterial DNA. DNA gyrase appears to be the primary quinolone target for gram-negative
    bacteria. Topoisomerase IV appears to be the preferential target in gram-positive
    organisms. Interference with these two topoisomerases results in strand breakage
    of the bacterial chromosome, supercoiling, and resealing. As a result DNA replication

    Once hydroxylated to 25-hydroxydihydrotachysterol, the modified drug binds to
    the vitamin D receptor. The bound form of the vitamin D receptor serves as a transcriptional
    regulator of bone matrix proteins, inducing the expression of osteocalcin and
    suppressing synthesis of type I collagen. Vitamin D (when bound to the vitamin
    D receptor)stimulates the expression of a number of proteins involved in transporting
    calcium from the lumen of the intestine, across the epithelial cells and into
    blood. This stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and increases renal phosphate

    Text:

    The mechanism of action of caffeine is complex, as it impacts several body systems,
    which are listed below. The effects as they relate to various body systems are
    described as follows: Adenosine receptor antagonism at the A1 receptor by caffeine
    stimulates inotropic effects in the heart. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes
    catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and
    the rest of the body.  In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism
    of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells
    in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation.
    Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic
    effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine
    is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by 5 to 10 mmHg when it
    is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.[T716]
    The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other
    types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.[A187709,L9872]

    Text:

    Cortisone acetate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding
    the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into
    the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE)
    in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts
    with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific
    target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to
    involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition
    arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
    Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which
    then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into
    contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid
    production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed,
    potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation
    Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids.
    Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular
    space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various
    inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis,
    respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal
    enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils,
    macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids
    due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin
    and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference
    with antigen-antibody binding.

    acid and electron-transport proteins of organisms, blocking nucleic acid synthesis.[L3754]
    The redox potential of the electron transport portions of anaerobic or microaerophilic

    Text:

    The effects of testosterone in humans and other vertebrates occur by way of two
    main mechanisms: by activation of the androgen receptor (directly or as DHT),
    and by conversion to estradiol and activation of certain estrogen receptors. Free
    testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where
    it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5&amp;alpha;-dihydrotestosterone
    (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5&amp;alpha;-reductase. DHT binds to the same
    androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is
    about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a
    structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly
    to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding
    are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity
    of certain genes, producing the androgen effects.

    \ inhibiting the absorption of cholesterol and phytosterol by the small intestine\
    \ without altering the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients.[A15202]\
    \ The primary target of ezetimibe is the cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick\
    \ C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein. NPC1L1 is expressed on enterocytes/gut lumen (apical)\
    \ as well as the hepatobiliary (canalicular) interface and plays a role in facilitating\
    \ internalization of free cholesterol into the enterocyte in conjunction with\
    \ the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex and clathrin.[A33309] Once cholesterol in\
    \ the gut lumen or bile is incorporated into the cell membrane of enterocytes,\
    \ it binds to the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1L1 and forms a NPC1L1/cholesterol\
    \ complex. The complex is then internalized or endocytosed by joining to AP2 clathrin,\
    \ forming a vesicle complex that is translocated for storage in the endocytic\
    \ recycling compartment.[A33309] Ezetimibe does not require exocrine pancreatic\
    \ function for its pharmacological activity; rather, it localizes and appears\
    \ to act at the brush border of the small intestine. Ezetimibe selectively blocks\
    \ the NPC1L1 protein in the jejunal brush border, reducing the uptake of intestinal\
    \ lumen micelles into the enterocyte.[A33309] Overall, ezetimibe causes a decrease\
    \ in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver and reduction of hepatic\
    \ cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood.\

    kinase, succinyl-CoA synthetase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and adenylosuccinate
    synthetase.[A903,A180781] Acyclovir triphosphate has higher affinity for viral
    DNA polymerase than cellular DNA polymerase and incorporates into the DNA where
    the missing 2'' and 3'' carbons causes DNA chain termination.[A180757] In other
    cases acyclovir triphosphate competes so strongly for viral DNA polymerase that

    Text:

    Patients with erythropoietic porphyria (EPP) have a deficiency of ferrochelatase
    (FECH), an enzyme involved in the final step of heme biosynthesis. FECH is required
    to insert iron into protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) to generate heme, and a deficiency
    in FECH results in accumulation of PPIX (particularly in the liver and superficial
    skin vasculature). PPIX molecules are photodynamic - exposure to UV radiation
    causes these molecules to form reactive oxygen species that lead to subsequent
    tissue damage.[A187199] Activation of MC1R signalling by afamelanotide also instigates
    other protective processes, including an increase in antioxidant activity, DNA
    repair, and secretion of immunomodulatory proteins such as interleukin-10.[A187202]
