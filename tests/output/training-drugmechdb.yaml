    Text:

    Liothyronine replaces endogenous thyroid hormone and then exerts its physiologic
    effects by controlling DNA transcription and protein synthesis. This effect on
    DNA is obtained by the binding of liothyronine to the thyroid receptors attached
    to DNA. Exogenous liothyronine exerts all the normal effects of the endogenous
    thyroid T3 hormone. Hence, it increases energy expenditure, accelerates the rate
    of cellular oxidation stimulating growth, maturation, and metabolism of the body
    tissues, aids in myelination of nerves and development of synaptic processes in
    the nervous system and enhances carbohydrate and protein metabolism.[T276]

    Text:

    This drug inhibits the L-type and T-type calcium channels, thereby leading to
    vasodilation and decreased automaticity of the heart. Efonidipine exerts negative
    chronotropic effects, decreasing heart rate. Acting on SA node cells by inhibiting
    T-type calcium channel activity, Efonidipine prolongs the late phase-4 depolarization
    of the sinoatrial node action potential, decreasing heart rate. This is associated
    with decreased myocardial oxygen demand and increases of blood flow to the coronary
    arteries and thereby attenuates myocardial ischemia.  Efonidipine increases glomerular
    filtration rate (GFR) without increasing intra-glomerular pressure and filtration
    fraction [A7844, A32003, A32010] . This increase leads to the prevention of renal
    damage that is normally associated with hypertension. Recent studies suggest that
    efonidipine reduces plasma aldosterone levels in patients on regular hemodialysis,
    which is of additional benefit to the cardiovascular protection by antihypertensive
    therapy with efonidipine in patients with end-stage renal disease [L1437].

    Although the exact mechanism of action of bleomycin is unknown, available evidence
    would seem to indicate that the main mode of action is the inhibition of DNA synthesis
    with some evidence of lesser inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis. As evident
    in _in vitro_ studies, the DNA-cleaving actions of bleomycin is dependent on oxygen
    and metal ions. It is believed that bleomycin chelates metal ions (primarily iron)
    producing a pseudoenzyme that reacts with oxygen to produce superoxide and hydroxide
    free radicals that cleave DNA.

    genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), IL-1-receptor antagonist,
    and tyrosine amino transferase (TAT).[A31458] On the other hand, the nongenomic

    Text:

    Azelastine is primarily a selective antagonist of histamine H1-receptors, with
    a lesser affinity for H2-receptors, used for the symptomatic treatment of allergies.[A1518,A1517,L8240,L8270]
    Histamine H1-receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors with 7 transmembrane spanning
    domains[A184328] that are found on nerve endings, smooth muscle cells, and glandular
    cells.[A687] Following allergen exposure in sensitized individuals, IgE-receptor
    cross-linking on mast cells results in the release of histamine, which binds to
    H1-receptors and contributes to typical allergic symptoms such as itching, sneezing,
    and congestion.[A687]  Though its primary mode of action is thought to be via
    H1-receptor antagonism, azelastine (like other second-generation antihistamines)
    appears to affect other mediators of allergic symptomatology. Azelastine has mast
    cell-stabilizing properties that prevent the release of interleukin-6, tryptase,
    histamine, and TNF-alpha[A1518] from mast cells, and has been shown to reduce
    mediators of mast cell degranulation such as leukotrienes in the nasal lavage
    of patients with rhinitis,[A1517] as well as inhibiting their production and release
    from eosinophils (potentially via inhibition of phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
    and leukotriene C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; synthase).[A1518,A184373] Additionally,
    patients using oral azelastine were observed to have significantly reduced concentrations
    of substance P and bradykinin in nasal secretions[A1518], both of which may play
    a role in nasal itching and sneezing in patients with allergic rhinitis.

    Text:

    The exact mechanisms by which valproate exerts it''s effects on epilepsy, migraine
    headaches, and bipolar disorder are unknown however several pathways exist which
    may contribute to the drug''s action. Finally, valproate acts as a direct histone
    deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.[A178030] Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones
    promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope
    of valproate''s genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.[A178027]
    The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized
    however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in
    bipolar patients.[A178033] Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing
    BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective
    mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.[A178036] H3 hyperacetylation
    is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a
    pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate''s neuroprotective effects.[A11814]

    Text:

    As a triazole antifungal agent, posaconazole exerts its antifungal activity through
    blockage of the cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme, sterol 14&amp;alpha;-demethylase,
    in fungi by binding to the heme cofactor located on the enzyme. This leads to
    the inhibition of the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell
    membrane, and accumulation of methylated sterol precursors. This results in inhibition
    of fungal cell growth and ultimately, cell death.

    Text:

    Epinephrine acts on alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine acts on alpha
    and beta receptors and is the strongest alpha receptor activator [F1247]. Through
    its action on alpha-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine minimizes the vasodilation
    and increased the vascular permeability that occurs during anaphylaxis, which
    can cause the loss of intravascular fluid volume as well as hypotension.  Epinephrine
    relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchi and iris and is a histamine antagonist,
    rendering it useful in treating the manifestations of allergic reactions and associated
    conditions [F2136]. This drug also produces an increase in blood sugar and increases
    glycogenolysis in the liver [F1247]. Through its action on beta-adrenergic receptors,
    epinephrine leads to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation that helps to relieve
    bronchospasm, wheezing, and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis [FDA label].

    Text:

    Olodaterol is a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) that exerts its pharmacological
    effect by binding and activating beta2-adrenergic receptors located primarily
    in the lungs. Beta2-adrenergic receptors are membrane-bound receptors that are
    normally activated by endogenous epinephrine whose signalling, via a downstream
    L-type calcium channel interaction, mediates smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation.
    Activation of the receptor stimulates an associated G protein which then activates
    adenylate cyclase, catalyzing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
    (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). Elevation of these two molecules induces bronchodilation
    by relaxation of airway smooth muscles.

    The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in

    corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
    inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. This is achieved first by
    the drug binding to the glucocorticoid receptors which then translocates into
    the nucleus and binds to DNA causing various activations and repressions of genes.
    It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators
    of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release
    of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from
    membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

    Text:

    Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor
    (the estrogen receptor). Estrogen interacts with a target cell receptor. When
    the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target
    cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA.
    The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the
    effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis
    of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other
    serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior
    pituitary. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland,
    the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis
    of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other
    serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior
    pituitary. The combination of an estrogen with a progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary
    system, decreasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).

    Text:

    Elevated intraocular pressure is a characteristic manifestation of ocular hypertension
    or open-angle glaucoma. The level of intraocular pressure (IOP) is governed by
    the balance between the production of aqueous humour (by ocular ciliary processes)
    and its outflow from the anterior segment of the eye via trabecular (conventional)
    or uveoscleral (unconventional) pathways. When there is an increase in the resistance
    to the trabecular outflow of aqueous humour, the intraocular pressure is elevated.
    Subsequently, optic nerve damage can occur from blood flow restrictions and mechanical
    distortion of ocular structures. Optic nerve damage can further result in optic
    disc cupping and progressive visual field loss (and blindness in some cases).[A1304]  Carbonic
    anhydrase (CA) is a ubiquitous enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration
    of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate ions and dehydration of carbonic acid.[A1304,L11377]
    In the ocular ciliary processes, the local production of bicarbonate by CAs promotes
    sodium and fluid transport. CA-II is a key isoenzyme found primarily in red blood
    cells (RBCs) that regulates aqueous humour production.[A1304] Dorzolamide is a
    highly specific CA-II inhibitor, where it displays a 4000-fold higher affinity
    for carbonic anhydrase II than carbonic anhydrase I.[A1304] The inhibition of
    CA-II in the ciliary process disrupts the formation of bicarbonate ions and reduces
    sodium and fluid transport, which leads to decreased aqueous humour secretion
    and reduced intraocular pressure.[A1304,L11377]

    these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such

    arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by
    phospholipase A2. Amcinonide has affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. It

    Text:

    Carbamazepine''s mechanism of action is not fully elucidated and is widely debated.[A180310,L7153]
    One major hypothesis is that carbamazepine inhibits sodium channel firing,  treating
    seizure activity. Animal research studies have demonstrated that carbamazepine
    exerts its effects by lowering polysynaptic nerve response and inhibiting post-tetanic
    potentiation. In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain
    caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in
    the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual
    mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine
    causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing
    action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves.[A180403,T634]
    In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and
    increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms.[L7216] A common
    issue that has arisen is resistance to this drug in up to 30% of epileptic patients,
    which may occur to altered metabolism in patients with variant genotypes.[A180436]
    A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently
    been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance
    to carbamazepine through methylation.[A180439]

    Text:

    Cortisone acetate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding
    the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into
    the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE)
    in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts
    with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific
    target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to
    involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition
    arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
    Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which
    then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into
    contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid
    production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed,
    potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation
    Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids.
    Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular
    space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various
    inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis,
    respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal
    enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils,
    macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids
    due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin
    and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference
    with antigen-antibody binding.

    Text:

    Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the mu-opioid receptor and an antagonist
    at the kappa-opioid receptor. It demonstrates a high affinity for the mu-opioid
    receptor but has lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists
    such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine
    preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids
    without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results
    in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the "ceiling effect"
    where once a certain dose is reached buprenorphine''s effects plateau. This effect
    can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression,
    sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk
    of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218]
    It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria
    at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving
    quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects
    of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280] Buprenorphine is
    commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated
    in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective
    competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination of an opioid agonist with
    an opioid antagonist may seem counterintuitive, however this combination with
    naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is
    poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would
    reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,F4715,F4718]

    Text:

    Insulin glulisine binds to the insulin receptor (IR), a heterotetrameric protein
    consisting of two extracellular alpha units and two transmembrane beta units.
    The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase
    activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates
    and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor
    substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins
    leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase
    and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein
    kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism.
    In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers
    are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for
    lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity
    to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid
    rate of absorption and short duration of action.

    effects. Promazine does not appear to block dopamine within the tubero-infundibular

    Salicylic acid directly irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and COX-2 to decrease conversion
    of arachidonic acid to precursors of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Salicylate''s
    use in rheumatic diseases is due to it''s analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity.
    Salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many skin-care products for the treatment
    of acne, psoriasis, calluses, corns, keratosis pilaris, and warts. Salicylic acid
    allows cells of the epidermis to more readily slough off. Because of its effect
    on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoos used to treat dandruff.
    Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas
    (plantar warts). Salicylic acid competitively inhibits oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose
    (UDPG) with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) and noncompetitively with
    UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of the glucuronyl group
    of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) to a phenolic acceptor. Inhibition
    of mucopoly saccharide synthesis is likely responsible for the slowing of wound

    Text:

    The precise mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of topical steroids in
    the treatment of steroid-responsive dermatoses, in general, is uncertain. However,
    corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
    inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these
    proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as
    prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor
    arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by
    phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These enzyme transcriptional changes
    are mediated by the drug binding first to the glucocorticoid receptor. This complex
    can migrate to the cell nucleus which then binds to DNA initiating genetic activation
    and repression of various genes.

    catecholamine neurotransmitters mainly on the presence of a long planar conformation,
    the presence of an aromatic ring and nitrogen in the aryl side chain. Amphetamine,
    as well as other catecholamines, is taken into presynaptic nerve terminals by
    the association with two sodium ions and one chloride ion. The complex of the
    amphetamine with the ions is actively transported by monoamine reuptake transporters.
    As amphetamine acts competitively with the endogenous monoamines, the greater
    the number of amphetamines the more internalized amphetamine will be found.[A18540]
    Lastly, amphetamine is known to be an inhibitor of the mitochondrial-bound enzyme
    MAO which is the catalytic enzyme in charge of degrading all the excess of neurotransmitters.
    This mechanism of action is often overpassed as amphetamine is a weak MAO inhibitor
    but this mechanism cannot be dismissed.[A18540]

    Glucocorticoids inhibit neutrophil apoptosis and demargination, and inhibit NF-Kappa
    B and other inflammatory transcription factors.[A187463] They also inhibit phospholipase
    A2, leading to decreased formation of arachidonic acid derivatives.[A187463] In
    addition, glucocorticoids promote anti-inflammatory genes like interleukin-10.[A187463]
    Corticosteroids like betamethasone can act through nongenomic and genomic pathways.[A31458]
    The genomic pathway is slower and occurs when glucocorticoids activate glucocorticoid
    receptors and initiate downstream effects that promote transcription of anti-inflammatory
    genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), IL-1-receptor antagonist,
    and tyrosine amino transferase (TAT).[A31458] On the other hand, the nongenomic
    pathway is able to elicit a quicker response by modulating T-cell, platelet and

    Epinephrine acts on alpha and beta-adrenergic receptors. Epinephrine acts on alpha
    and beta receptors and is the strongest alpha receptor activator [F1247]. Through
    its action on alpha-adrenergic receptors, epinephrine minimizes the vasodilation
    and increased the vascular permeability that occurs during anaphylaxis, which
    can cause the loss of intravascular fluid volume as well as hypotension.  Epinephrine
    relaxes the smooth muscle of the bronchi and iris and is a histamine antagonist,
    rendering it useful in treating the manifestations of allergic reactions and associated
    conditions [F2136]. This drug also produces an increase in blood sugar and increases
    glycogenolysis in the liver [F1247]. Through its action on beta-adrenergic receptors,
    epinephrine leads to bronchial smooth muscle relaxation that helps to relieve
    bronchospasm, wheezing, and dyspnea that may occur during anaphylaxis [FDA label].

    Text:

    Allopurinol is a structural analog of the natural purine base, hypoxanthine.  After
    ingestion, allopurinol is metabolized to its active metabolite, oxypurinol (_alloxanthine_)
    in the liver [T508], which acts as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme [FDA
    label].  Accompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase
    in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition
    of xanthine oxidase).  In the absence of allopurinol, regular urinary excretion
    of oxypurines almost entirely occurs in the form of uric acid. After the ingestion
    of allopurinol, the contents of excreted urine are hypoxanthine, xanthine, and
    uric acid. Because each substance has its own individual solubility, the concentration
    of uric acid in plasma is decreased without exposing the renal tissues to a high
    load of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of crystalluria. By lowering the
    uric acid concentration in the plasma below its limits of solubility, allopurinol
    encourages the dissolution of gout tophi. Although the levels of hypoxanthine
    and xanthine are found to be increased after allopurinol ingestion, the risk of
    deposition in renal tissues is less than that of uric acid, as they become more
    soluble and are rapidly excreted by the kidney [F3988].

    Text:

    Cortisone acetate binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding
    the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into
    the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE)
    in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts
    with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific
    target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to
    involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition
    arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
    Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which
    then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into
    contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid
    production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed,
    potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation
    Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids.
    Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular
    space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various
    inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis,
    respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal
    enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils,
    macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids
    due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin
    and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference
    with antigen-antibody binding.

    wall by forming covalent bonds with penicillin-binding proteins that play a critical

    Text:

    Dopamine is a precursor to norepinephrine in noradrenergic nerves and is also
    a neurotransmitter in certain areas of the central nervous system. Dopamine produces
    positive chronotropic and inotropic effects on the myocardium, resulting in increased
    heart rate and cardiac contractility. This is accomplished directly by exerting
    an agonist action on beta-adrenoceptors and indirectly by causing release of norepinephrine
    from storage sites in sympathetic nerve endings. In the brain, dopamine actas
    as an agonist to the five dopamine receptor subtypes (D!, D2, D3, D4, D5).

    Text:

    The mechanism of action of trifluridine as an antiviral agent has not been fully
    elucidated, but appears to involve the inhibition of viral replication. Trifluridine
    gets incorporated into viral DNA during replication, which leads to the formation
    of defective proteins and an increased mutation rate. Trifluridine also mediates
    antineoplastic activities via this mechanism; following uptake into cancer cells,
    trifluridine is rapidly phosphorylated by thymidine kinase to its active monophosphate
    form [A35272]. Subsequent phosphorylation produces trifluridine triphosphate [A35272],
    which is readily incorporated into the DNA of tumour cells in place of thymidine
    bases to perturb DNA function, DNA synthesis, and tumour cell proliferation [FDA
    Label]. As trifluridine is subject to rapid degradation by TPase and readily metabolised
    by a first-pass effect following oral administration, tipiracil is added in the
    antineoplastic combination product as an inhibitor of TPase to increase the bioavailability
    of trifluridine [F649]. Trifluridine monophosphate also reversibly inhibits thymidylate
    synthetase (TS), an enzyme that is necessary for DNA synthesis and which levels
    are shown to be elevated different cancer cell lines [A35289]. Up-regulation of
    the expression of the TS enzyme may also lead to the resistance to antineoplastic
    therapies, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [A35289]. However, this inhibitory effect
    is not considered to be sufficient enough to fully contribute to the cytotoxicity
    in cancer cells [A35272].

    Text:

    Although the exact mechanism of action of guaifenesin may not yet be formally
    or totally elucidated, it is believed that expectorants like guaifenesin function
    by increasing mucus secretion [A177661]. Moreover, it is also further proposed
    that such expectorants may also act as an irritant to gastric vagal receptors,
    and recruit efferent parasympathetic reflexes that can elicit glandular exocytosis
    that is comprised of a less viscous mucus mixture [A177661]. Subsequently, these
    actions may provoke coughing that can ultimately flush difficult to access, congealed
    mucopurulent material from obstructed small airways to facilitate a temporary
    improvement for the individual [A177661]. Consequently, while it is generally
    proposed that guaifenesin functions as an expectorant by helping to loosen phlegm
    (mucus) and thin bronchial secretions to rid the bronchial passageways of bothersome
    mucus and make coughs more productive, there has also been research to suggest
    that guaifenesin possesses and is capable of demonstrating anticonvulsant and
    muscle relaxant effects to some degree possibly by acting as an NMDA receptor
    antagonist [A177652].

    Fluoxymesterone is a synthetic androgenic anabolic steroid and is approximately
    5 times as potent as natural methyltestosterone. Like testosterone and other androgenic
    hormones, fluoxymesterone binds to the androgen receptor. It produces retention
    of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus; increases protein anabolism; decreases
    amino acid catabolism and decreased urinary excretion of calcium. The antitumour
    activity of fluoxymesterone appears related to reduction or competitive inhibition

    The exact mechanism of action of metronidazole has not been fully established,

    acid and electron-transport proteins of organisms, blocking nucleic acid synthesis.[L3754]
    The redox potential of the electron transport portions of anaerobic or microaerophilic

    N-(2-hydroxyethyl) oxamic acid and acetamide, which may damage DNA of replicating

    \ cleaves the HCV polyprotein downstream of the NS3 site, generating non-structural\
    \ viral proteins NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5A and subsequently formation of\
    \ mature proteins [A19630, A19632]. Simeprevir exerts an inhibitory action on\
    \ HCV polyprotein cleavage via induced-fit binding to an extended S2 subsite located\
    \ in the NS3 catalytic site [A19633]. NS3/4A inhibitors usually depend on few\
    \ interactions located in the substrate binding groove of the viral serine protease,\
    \ thus are susceptible to resistance and failed treatment from few critical mutations\
    \ in these sites.  At higher concentration above their antiviral half-maximal\
    \ effective concentration (EC50), simeprevir and other NS3/4A inhibitors also\
    \ restore interferon (IFN)-signaling pathways that are thought to be disrupted\
    \ by NS3/4A protease and recover innate immune processes. NS3/4A protease cleaves\
    \ two essential adaptor proteins that initiate signaling leading to activation\
    \ of IFN regulatory factor 3 and IFN-\u03B1/\u03B2 synthesis, which are mitochondrial\
    \ antiviral-signaling proteins (MAVS otherwise known as IPS-1, VISA, or Cardif)\
    \ and toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)- domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-\u03B2\
    \ (TRIF). Blocking the function of these adaptor proteins results in impaired\
    \ interferon induction. NS3/4A inhibitors recover the proper IFN-signaling pathways\
    \ [A19630, A19632].\n\n===\n\ndisease: Hepatitis C, Chronic\ndrug: Simeprevir\n"

    Text:

    Galsulfase supplies recombinant-engineered galsulfase, a normal variant form of
    the polymorphic human enzyme, N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfatase. It is a lysosomal
    hydrolase that catalyzes the cleavage of the sulfate ester from terminal N-acetylgalactosamine
    4-sulfate residues of GAG chondroitin 4-sulfate and dermatan sulfate. Increased
    catabolism of GAG in turn reduces systemic dermatan sulfate accumulation, thereby
    reducing the primary symptoms of MPS VI.
