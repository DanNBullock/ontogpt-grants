input_text: "Development of genomic resources for Sphagnum magellanicum (Bryophyta:\
  \ peat moss) is proposed to enable genetic and molecular research related to environmental\
  \ genomics, phylogenetics of early land plants, population genetics, and speciation.\
  \ Most significantly, peat mosses, and Sphagnum magellanicum specifically, have\
  \ tremendous impacts on global carbon budgets and climate. The phylogenetic position\
  \ of Sphagnum as an early diverging lineage of land plants adds value to the project,\
  \ and molecular tools enabled by such a resource will promote the continuing (and\
  \ expanding) utilization of Sphagnum for research in population genetics and evolution.\n\
  \nThere is one other bryophyte genome (Physcomitrella patens) that is designated\
  \ as one of JGI\u2019s Flagship Genomes. While Physcomitrella has some advantageous\
  \ features for functional genomics, the species is very rare in nature, is poorly\
  \ characterized ecologically, and, as a tiny annual species, is not suitable for\
  \ research on carbon cycling or climate change. Therefore, our proposal will leverage\
  \ genomic resources already available for Physcomitrella by establishing a modern\
  \ genomic resource for Sphagnum magellanicum, which is an important plant species\
  \ with regard to carbon sequestration. A Sphagnum resource will also increase the\
  \ value of Physcomitrella as a model flagship species and establish a plant model\
  \ of tremendous importance for climate change research.\n\nSphagnum (peat moss)\
  \ arguably has a greater impact on global carbon fluxes and therefore climate than\
  \ any other single genus of plants. Peatlands develop where net production exceeds\
  \ decomposition over extended time and some Sphagnum-dominated peatlands have accumulated\
  \ tens of meters of partially decomposed plant material that store some 400 gigatons\
  \ of carbon. Sphagnum magellanicum is a dominant species in peatlands throughout\
  \ the subarctic and boreal zones, extends southward to subtropical Florida in the\
  \ U.S., and through the Andes to Tierra del Fuego. It is estimated that approximately\
  \ 30% of terrestrial carbon is stored in peatlands that occupy only about 10% of\
  \ the earth\u2019s land surface. Low decomposition rates in Sphagnum-dominated peatlands\
  \ result from a combination of abiotic conditions (cold temperatures, low nutrients,\
  \ anoxia) and biological features of the Sphagnum plants themselves. Although uniformly\
  \ slow to decompose relative to vascular plants, different species of Sphagnum are\
  \ characterized by variable rates of decomposition and species-specific traits scale\
  \ up to impact community structure and ecosystem function. Understanding the nature\
  \ and genetic basis of variation in functional traits that impact Sphagnum growth\
  \ and decomposition is essential for making predictions about ecosystem consequences\
  \ of ongoing climate change. Important functional traits with substantive ecosystem-scale\
  \ consequences include whole plant productivity and decomposition rates, nitrogen\
  \ and phosphorous contents, foliar pH, and production of Sphagnum acids. While Sphagnum\
  \ serves an important primary role in carbon dynamics of high-latitude ecosystems,\
  \ it also serves a secondary role in insulating permafrost, thus dampening the influence\
  \ of rising temperatures on vast amounts of carbon stored in arctic tundra. Some\
  \ of these traits co-vary with microhabitat specialization among Sphagnum species,\
  \ enabling research that connects field studies of species biology and community\
  \ structure, ecosystem function, global carbon fluxes, and control of past, present,\
  \ and future climate.\n"
