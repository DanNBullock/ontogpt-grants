input_text: "According to the American Psychiatric Association, second-generation\
  \ (atypical) antipsychotics (SGAs)\u2014with the exception of clozapine\u2014are\
  \ the agents of choice for first-line treatment of schizophrenia.16,25 Clozapine\
  \ is not recommended because of its risk of agranulocytosis.2 SGAs are usually preferred\
  \ over first-generation (typical) antipsychotics (FGAs) because they are associated\
  \ with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms.2 However, SGAs tend to have metabolic side\
  \ effects, such as weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus.26 These adverse\
  \ effects can contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular mortality observed\
  \ in schizophrenia patients.26\n\nThe Texas Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP)\
  \ has provided a six-stage pharmacotherapeutic algorithm for the treatment of schizophrenia.\
  \ Stage 1 is first-line monotherapy with an SGA. If the patient shows little or\
  \ no response, he or she should proceed to stage 2, which consists of monotherapy\
  \ with either another SGA or an FGA. If there is still no response, the patient\
  \ should move to stage 3, which consists of clozapine monotherapy with monitoring\
  \ of the white blood cell (WBC) count.24 If agranulocytosis occurs, clozapine should\
  \ be discontinued. If stage-3 therapy fails to elicit a response, the patient should\
  \ proceed to stage 4, which combines clozapine with an FGA, an SGA, or electroconvulsive\
  \ therapy (ECT).24 If the patient still shows no response to treatment, stage 5\
  \ calls for monotherapy with an FGA or an SGA that has not been tried.24 Finally,\
  \ if stage 5 treatment is unsuccessful, stage 6 consists of combination therapy\
  \ with an SGA, an FGA, ECT, and/or a mood stabilizer."
