input_text: "Title: Fungal, bacterial, and archaeal communities mediating C cycling\n\
  and trace gas flux in peatland ecosystems subject to climate change\n\nAbstract:\n\
  Metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses. In the second part of this study we will\
  \ conduct in-depth analysis to integrate metagenomics and metatranscriptomics studies\
  \ that will leverage two i\nntensive peatland climate change experiments: PEATcosm\
  \ (USDA & NSF funded) and SPRUCE (DOE funded). The PEATcosm experiment is investigating\
  \ the effects of water table and peatland vegetation on trace gas flux in bog ecosystems.\
  \ Dominant vascular plants (heath and sedge family) are hypothesized to be key ecosystem\
  \ engineers that influence microbial community structure both via symbiotic associations\
  \ that have strong extracellular enzyme activity (Ericaeae), and by transport of\
  \ oxygen and labile C into the peat (Carex).  We will investigate 8 microenvironments:\
  \ Ericaceae and sedge rhizosphere peat, at two depths, in both high and low water\
  \ manipulative treatments simulating anticipated climate-mediated changes in water\
  \ balance. We anticipate collecting 3 replicate samples per sample type to be used\
  \ for both metagenome and metatranscriptome seque\nncing; each set of 3 could be\
  \ pooled on a single lane of Illumina HiSeq, bringing the total to 16 lanes. The\
  \ SPRUCE experiment is designed to understand threshold level responses of a peatland\
  \ system to experimental warming.  It features fourteen plots that will be heated\
  \ over a temperature gradient of 0 to +9 \xB0C above ambient, factorial with CO2\
  \ enrichment over a 10yr period.  The experiment is being constructed in Minnesota\
  \ with heating scheduled to begin in spring of 2014. Pretreatment environmental,\
  \ vegetation and biogeochemical data has already been collected over the last 3\
  \ years.  To complement such efforts, we are requesting analysis from 70 samples\
  \ representing spatial and depth variation across the bog (14 plots/5 depths). Our\
  \ goal is to provide baseline data on community functional genomic potential (metagenomic\
  \ DNA) and their activities (metatranscriptomic RNA) in order to guide future intensive\
  \ investigations at this site.  We anticipate multiplexing of up to 10 DNA or RNA\
  \ samples per lane of the HiSeq for a total of 14 lanes of capacity for this part\n"
