input_text: "Mersiyanova et al. (2000) reported a large 6-generation family from Russia\
  \ with autosomal dominant CMT2. Onset was in the second and third decade, characterized\
  \ by difficulty in walking and weakness and atrophy of the distal lower limb muscles\
  \ and a variable degree of deformity of the feet (pes cavus). Affected individuals\
  \ did not exhibit enlarged nerves, ulcerated feet, hearing impairment, or paralysis\
  \ of the vocal cords. Several patients had hyperkeratosis, although the association,\
  \ if any, between the 2 disorders was not clear. The authors suggested the designation\
  \ CMT2E for this disorder. \n\nGeorgiou et al. (2002) described a large 5-generation\
  \ Slovenian family with autosomal dominant CMT type 2E. Disease onset in most patients\
  \ was in the first decade of life. The presenting symptoms were difficulty in walking\
  \ or running, due to a slowly progressive distal weakness and wasting of the lower\
  \ limbs. A steppage gait, pes cavus, and hammertoes were typically present. Over\
  \ a period of 20 years after disease onset, two-thirds of patients developed upper\
  \ limb involvement resulting in claw hands. All patients were ambulatory 20 to 30\
  \ years after onset. \n\nFabrizi et al. (2004) reported a large kindred from southern\
  \ Italy with autosomal dominant CMT2E spanning 5 generations and caused by mutation\
  \ in the NEFL gene (162280.0002). An affected woman and her 2 affected sons had\
  \ steppage gait, ataxic gait, peroneal muscular atrophy, decreased vibration sense\
  \ with stocking and glove distribution, and hypotrophy of the hand muscles. One\
  \ of the sons had claw hand deformities. Motor nerve conduction velocities (NCV)\
  \ were decreased, consistent with a demyelinating neuropathy, but sural nerve biopsy\
  \ of the mother showed a primary axonopathy characterized by giant axons containing\
  \ disorganized neurofilaments. \n\nMiltenberger-Miltenyi et al. (2007) reported\

  \ analysis (162880.0006). Disease onset was in the second decade of life with pes\
  \ cavus, progressive plantar extensor weakness, and distal lower limb atrophy and\
  \ weakness. Two patients became wheelchair-bound. Affected members of a second Austrian\
  \ family, with a different NEFL mutation (162280.0003), had disease onset before\
  \ age 15 years in all but 1 patient. The disorder was slowly progressive but resulted\
  \ in a severe and disabling phenotype. Electrophysiologic studies of both families\
  \ showed intermediate motor nerve conduction velocities consistent with axonal pathology.\n"
