input_text: "Sediment communities from the hyporheic zone of the Columbia River along\
  \ the Hanford Reach were sampled from April 30, 2014 to November 25, 2014, using\
  \ sand packs deployed at three equivalent hyporheic zone locations approximately\
  \ 100m apart along the river (T2, T3, and T4) for six weeks at a time [22]. Water\
  \ chemistry data taken in parallel at the three sites showed similar, yet not identical\
  \ temporal patterns. A mid-year shift in hydraulic regime was observed, with higher\
  \ influx of surface water in the spring resulting in higher levels of dissolved\
  \ organic carbon (measured as non-purgeable organic carbon) (NPOC) (0.8\u20131.0\
  \ mg/L) (Fig 2A) and low levels of nitrate (10\u201315 \u03BCM) (Fig 2B), transitioning\
  \ to a more groundwater-influenced condition in the fall, increasing the nitrate\
  \ concentrations (up to 300 \u03BCM) and decreasing NPOC concentration (down to\
  \ <0.4 mg/L). Because the groundwater in this system is oxic, the DO concentration\
  \ was fairly constant for the duration of sampling, ranging from ~60\u2013100% saturation\
  \ (Fig 2C). The water temperature followed expected seasonal trends, warming in\
  \ the summer and cooling in the fall (Fig 2D). Sampling times were categorized as\
  \ early (Apr 30 through Jul 22) or late (Sep 2 through Nov 30), based on these observations.\n"
