input_text: "Disease: Ehlers Danlos Syndrome\nTreatment:\nThe care of patients with\
  \ EDS is generally focused on implementing preventative measures against serious\
  \ or life-threatening complications. The primary complications seen in EDS involve\
  \ the skin, musculoskeletal, and cardiovascular systems. Patient skin is velvety\
  \ thin, loose, and stretchable. This predisposes patients to difficulties with wound\
  \ healing. For both accidental and surgical wounds, deep stiches are applied generously.\
  \ Superficial stiches are placed to carefully realign the skin to prevent scarring.\
  \ Stiches are also left in for extended periods of time to allow best strengthening\
  \ of the forming scar tissue. Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) may be recommended to help\
  \ reduce the easy bruising that accompanies EDS. Hypermobile joints easily dislocate.\
  \ With each dislocation, subsequent dislocations are increasingly likely, therefore\
  \ prevention is particularly important for quality of life. Heavy sports, lifting,\
  \ and other strenuous efforts should be avoided due to the risk of inciting trauma.\
  \ Blood vessel fragility increases the risk for serious bleeds and dissections.\
  \ High blood pressure (hypertension) puts additional strain on the fragile vasculature\
  \ and increases the risk for complications. Regular screening for hypertension and\
  \ arterial disease should be conducted and treatment should be initiated early on.\
  \ The best approaches to screening are by non-invasive technology: ultrasound, MRI,\
  \ or CT. Arteriography, colonoscopy, and other similarly invasive screening procedures\
  \ should be considered carefully for benefit versus risk. Surgery for non-life threatening\
  \ conditions should also be carefully considered. Pregnancies should be followed\
  \ by obstetricians that are well trained in dealing with high-risk pregnancies.\
  \ Delivery can progress very quickly in EDS patients and it is yet unclear if there\
  \ is an advantage to mothers to deliver by vaginal or cesarean routes. Expectant\
  \ mothers with known aortic root dilations should have echocardiograms each trimester\
  \ to observe for possible exacerbation. All EDS-affected individuals should seek\
  \ immediate medical attention for any sudden or unexplained pains and consider wearing\
  \ a MedicAlert bracelet to communicate their status as a patient with EDS should\
  \ they lose consciousness.\n\nhEDS patients may especially benefit from physical\
  \ therapy, low-resistance exercise, and assistive devices like braces, wheelchairs,\
  \ and scooters. Comfortable writing utensils and a low-stress mattress serve an\
  \ important role in reducing musculoskeletal pain. Pain management is tailored to\
  \ the individual. Gastrointestinal and psychological complications are likewise\
  \ managed per an individual\u2019s needs. In addition to physical therapy and low-resistance\
  \ exercise, calcium and vitamin D can help maximize bone density. DEXA bone density\
  \ scans should be conducted every other year. kEDS patients should have routine\
  \ eye exams as they are at risk for globus rupture, retinal detachment and glaucoma.\
  \ dEDS patients may benefit from protective bandages over exposed areas such as\
  \ the skin of the elbows and knees.\n"
